## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual representation of a website or application's layout and structure. It focuses on the core elements and functionality, without the distractions of visual design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Think of it as a blueprint for your digital product.

## Importance in the Design Process
Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design process by:
- Clarifying structure and content: It helps in defining the hierarchy of information and the placement of key elements.
- Facilitating early feedback: Stakeholders can review and provide input on the layout and user flow before significant design work begins, saving time and resources.
- Improving usability: By focusing on functionality and user experience, wireframes help identify potential usability issues early on.
- Streamlining development: A clear wireframe provides developers with a solid foundation to build upon, reducing misunderstandings and rework.
